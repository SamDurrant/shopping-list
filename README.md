Welcome! This project is an interactive shopping list React app collaboration between Alex Morton and Samantha Durrant.

More details coming soon!

--------------------------------------------

Goals:

- Around ten hours per week to allow for time to spend on individual projects.
- Weekly catch-up over Zoom toward the end of each week to catch up on what was accomplished over the week as well as to make plans for the following week.

- Styling our project - Considering CSS for each component or other style libraries within React.

- State management - Redux?

- Name - no brilliant ideas yet, but waiting on inspiration!!

- List will mainly focus on grocery items - could be cool to integrate a way for users to categorize their items and then we could find some way of displaying that. Example: 'Oh no, obviously I need to be buying more vegetables!'

Structure/Design 

- Broad plan for component structure

- App.js/App.css 
- InputBar.js/InputBar.css 
- GroceryList.js/GroceryList.css (to be rendered when each new item is added to Input)
- GroceryItem.js/GroceryItem.css
- AddButton.js/AddButton.css
- RemoveButton.js/RemoveButton.css
- Header (Navbar) / Footer
